# S2D EXAMPLES

This folder contains some examples of what S2D is capable of. I will also try to give some context about how these examples work and how the S2D API works. <br>
_These examples were inspired by the **RAYLIB** examples_

## Contributing
I would love to add any examples that users make for S2D, big and small.

If you have built something that could be used as an example please fork the project, add the example code into the `examples` folder and make a Pull Request.<br>

_**It would be nice to keep examples simple, but if you want to work on a more complex one that is also welcome!**_
